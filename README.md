# Hyper Swipe Code Challenge

Excerpt from the assignment:

> This is a small test to look at your structure, workflow and code skills as a
> developer. We are looking for a pixel perfect design implementation with your
> own touch to the swiping.
>
> The challenge consists of a simple single-page app where you swipe cards
> between "Like" and "Dislike", just like Tinder. You'll be provided with a
> simple API containing the cards and the results of your swiping should be
> saved in localstorage.
